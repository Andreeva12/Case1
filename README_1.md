| **Requirement Analysis**            | 1-2        | Detailed collection and analysis of functional and non-functional requirements. Creation of a traceability matrix to link requirements with tests. | **Requirement Analysis:** Use of documentation analysis methods, stakeholder interviews. <br> **Traceability Matrix Creation:** Linking each requirement to corresponding tests to ensure complete coverage. |
| **Test Planning**                   | 3          | Development of the overall test plan, defining types and levels of testing, preparing test documentation.      | **Testing Pyramid:** Determining the proportion between unit, integration, and acceptance tests. <br> **Test Case Planning:** Development of detailed test cases describing steps, expected outcomes, and acceptance criteria. |
| **Test Environment and Test Preparation** | 4-6      | Setting up the test environment and tools. Development and validation of test cases and scenarios.             | **UI Testing:** Checking all interface elements on different devices and browsers. <br> **API Testing:** Testing API for specification compliance and correct request processing. <br> **Security Testing:** Vulnerability checks. |
| **Test Execution**                  | 7-10       | Execution of test scenarios, documentation of results, defect management, collaboration with developers to fix issues. | **Functional Testing:** Testing all key application functions. <br> **Performance Testing:** Assessing application performance under load. <br> **Usability Testing:** Gathering user feedback. |
| **Release Preparation and Support** | 11-12      | Final regression and acceptance testing before product release.
